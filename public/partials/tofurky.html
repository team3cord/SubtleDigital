   <h1>Tofurky</h1>
   <p>Working with Tofurky's in house design team. I was able to implement a new custom WordPress theme for the Talking Tofurky blog.  The responsive theme has a Masonry JavaScript grid layout on the blog index page and a unique custom JavaScript sticky header with a slide out search feild.</p>
